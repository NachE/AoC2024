# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

Welcome to my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024). This repository contains my personal implementations of the daily programming challenges throughout December 2024.

## 📋 Overview

If some days are missing solutions, it's likely because I didn't find the challenges particularly interesting or didn't prioritize them. Additionally, there's a `build.sh` script in this repository that I used to generate the boilerplate code for all days.

These solutions aim to balance simplicity of code with achieving the desired result. The focus is not on providing the most elegant or optimal solution, but rather on solving the problem in the simplest way possible. As the complexity of the challenges increases, the proposed solutions naturally adjust to meet those demands.

Each directory corresponds to a day's challenge and includes:

- **Problem Description**: A brief summary of the challenge in description.txt
- **Solution**: My code solution for the problem in the main.go
- **Input**: The input provided: input.txt

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Go

## 🚀 Running the Solutions

Instructions to run the code:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nache/AoC2024.git
```

2.	Navigate to the day's directory:

```bash   
cd AoC2024/dayX
```

3.	Run the solution:

```bash
go run main.go
```

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These solutions are my personal interpretations of the Advent of Code challenges. If you're participating, I encourage you to solve the problems on your own before referring to any external solutions.
